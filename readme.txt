The DumpTruck Problem
• Six dump trucks are used to haul coal from the entrance of a small mine
to the railroad
• Each truck is loaded by one of two loaders
• After loading, the truck immediately moves to the scale, to be weighed
• Loader and Scale have a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) queue
• The travel time from loader to scale is negligible
• After being weighed, a truck begins to travel, afterwards unloads the coal
and returns to the loader queue
• Purpose of the study: Estimation of the loader and scale utilizations.
